### Preface by Scott Chacon

- The first edition was published over four years ago now.

<br>

- When I wrote the first edition, Git was still a relatively difficult to use and barely adopted tool for the harder core hacker.

- Since then, nearly every open source community has adopted it. 

- One of the main aims of this new edition is to touch on all of those new frontiers in the Git community.

<br>

- The Open Source community using Git has also exploded.

- When I originally sat down to write the book nearly five years ago, I had just started working at a very little known company developing a Git hosting website called GitHub.

- Love it or hate it, GitHub has heavily changed large swaths of the Open Source community in a way that was barely conceivable when I sat down to write the first edition.

<br>

- I wrote a small section in the original version of Pro Git about GitHub as an example of hosted Git which I was never very comfortable with.

- I didn’t much like that I was writing what I felt was essentially a community resource and also talking about my company in it.

- While I still don’t love that conflict of interests, the importance of GitHub in the Git community is unavoidable. 

- If you are going to learn how to use Git then knowing how to use GitHub will help you take part in a huge community, which is valuable no matter which Git host you decide to use for your own code.

<br>

- The other large change in the time since the last publishing has been the development and rise of the HTTP protocol for Git network transactions.

- Most of the examples in the book have been changed to HTTP from SSH because it’s so much simpler.

- I’m happy that Pro Git has done so well and has also been able to be one of the few technical books on the market that is both quite successful and fully open source.

### Preface by Ben Straub

- The first edition of this book is what got me hooked on Git.

<br>

- Now, years later, I’m a contributor to a major Git implementation, I’ve worked for the largest Git hosting company, and I’ve traveled the world teaching people about Git.

### Introduction

- Here is a quick summary of the ten chapters and three appendices of this book.

<br>

- In Chapter 1, we’re going to cover Version Control Systems (VCSs) and Git basics — no technical stuff, just what Git is, why it came about in a land full of VCSs, what sets it apart, and why so many people are using it.

- Then, we’ll explain how to download Git and set it up for the first time if you don’t already have it on your system.

<br>

- In Chapter 2, we will go over basic Git usage — how to use Git in the 80% of cases you’ll encounter most often.

- After reading this chapter, you should be able to clone a repository, see what has happened in the history of the project, modify files, and contribute changes.

<br>

- Chapter 3 is about the branching model in Git, often described as Git’s killer feature.

- Here you’ll learn what truly sets Git apart from the pack.

<br>

- Chapter 4 will cover Git on the server.

- This chapter is for those of you who want to set up Git inside your organization or on your own personal server for collaboration.

- We will also explore various hosted options if you prefer to let someone else handle that for you.

<br>

- Chapter 5 will go over in full detail various distributed workflows and how to accomplish them with Git.

- When you are done with this chapter, you should be able to work expertly with multiple remote repositories, use Git over email and deftly juggle numerous remote branches and contributed patches.

<br>

- Chapter 6 covers the GitHub hosting service and tooling in depth.

- We cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to projects and to accept contributions to yours, GitHub’s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make your life easier in general.
<br>

- Chapter 7 is about advanced Git commands.

- Here you will learn about topics like mastering the scary 'reset' command, using binary search to identify bugs, editing history, revision selection in detail, and a lot more.

- This chapter will round out your knowledge of Git so that you are truly a master.

- Chapter 8 is about configuring your custom Git environment. This includes setting up hook scripts to enforce or encourage customized policies and using environment configuration settings so you can work the way you want to.

- We will also cover building your own set of scripts to enforce a custom committing policy.

- Chapter 9 deals with Git and other VCSs. This includes using Git in a Subversion (SVN) world and converting projects from other VCSs to Git.

- A lot of organizations still use SVN and are not about to change, but by this point you’ll have learned the incredible power of Git — and this chapter shows you how to cope if you still have to use a SVN server.

- We also cover how to import projects from several different systems in case you do convince everyone to make the plunge.

<br>

- Chapter 10 delves into the murky yet beautiful depths of Git internals.

- Now that you know all about Git and can wield it with power and grace, you can move on to discuss how Git stores its objects, what the object model is, details of packfiles, server protocols, and more.

- Throughout the book, we will refer to sections of this chapter in case you feel like diving deep at that point; but if you are like us and want to dive into the technical details, you may want to read Chapter 10 first.

- We leave that up to you.

<br>

- In Appendix A, we look at a number of examples of using Git in various specific environments.

- We cover a number of different GUIs and IDE programming environments that you may want to use Git in and what is available for you.

- If you’re interested in an overview of using Git in your shell, your IDE, or your text editor, take a look here.

<br>

- In Appendix B, we explore scripting and extending Git through tools like libgit2 and JGit.

- If you’re interested in writing complex and fast custom tools and need low-level Git access, this is where you can see what that landscape looks like.

<br>

- Finally, in Appendix C, we go through all the major Git commands one at a time and review where in the book we covered them and what we did with them.

- If you want to know where in the book we used any specific Git command you can look that up here.
