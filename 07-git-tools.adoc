= 7. Git Tools

* By now, you've learned most of the day-to-day commands and workflows that
  you need to manage or maintain a Git repository for your source code
  control.
* You've accomplished the basic tasks of tracking and committing files, and
  you've harnessed the power of the staging area and lightweight topic
  branching and merging.

'''

* Now you'll explore a number of very powerful things that Git can do that you
  may not necessarily use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need at some
  point.

== 7.8 Advanced Merging

* Merging in Git is typically fairly easy.
* Since Git makes it easy to merge another branch multiple times, it means
  that you can have a very long lived branch but you can keep it up to date as
  you go, solving small conflicts often, rather than be surprised by one
  enormous conflict at the end of the series.

'''

* However, sometimes tricky conflicts do occur.
* Unlike some other version control systems, Git does not try to be overly
  clever about merge conflict resolution.
* Git's philosophy is to be smart about determining when a merge resolution is
  unambiguous, but if there is a conflict, it does not try to be clever about
  automatically resolving it.
* Therefore, if you wait too long to merge two branches that diverge quickly,
  you can run into some issues.

'''

* In this section, we'll go over what some of those issues might be and what
  tools Git gives you to help handle these more tricky situations.
* We'll also cover some of the different, non-standard types of merges you can
  do, as well as see how to back out of merges that you've done.

=== Other Types of Merges

* So far we've covered the normal merge of two branches, normally handled with
  what is called the "recursive" strategy of merging.
* There are other ways to merge branches together however.
* Let's cover a few of them quickly.

==== Subtree Merging

* The idea of the subtree merge is that you have two projects, and one of the
  projects maps to a subdirectory of the other one.
* When you specify a subtree merge, Git is often smart enough to figure out
  that one is a subtree of the other and merge appropriately.

'''

* We'll go through an example of adding a separate project into an existing
  project and then merging the code of the second into a subdirectory of the
  first.

'''

* First, we'll add the Rack application to our project.
* We'll add the Rack project as a remote reference in our own project and then
  check it out into its own branch:
+
[,sh]
----
$ git remote add rack_remote https://github.com/rack/rack
$ git fetch rack_remote --no-tags
warning: no common commits
remote: Counting objects: 3184, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1465/1465), done.

From https://github.com/rack/rack
 * [new branch] build -> rack_remote/build
 * [new branch] master -> rack_remote/master
 * [new branch] rack-0.4 -> rack_remote/rack-0.4
 * [new branch] rack-0.9 -> rack_remote/rack-0.9
$ git checkout -b rack_branch rack_remote/master
Branch rack_branch set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/rack_remote/master.
Switched to a new branch "rack_branch"
----

* Now we have the root of the Rack project in our `rack_branch` branch and our
  own project in the `master` branch.
* If you check out one and then the other, you can see that they have
  different project roots:
+
[source,sh]
$ ls
AUTHORS KNOWN-ISSUES Rakefile contrib lib
COPYING README bin example test
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch "master"
$ ls
README

* This is sort of a strange concept.
* Not all the branches in your repository actually have to be branches of the
  same project.
* It's not common, because it's rarely helpful, but it's fairly easy to have
  branches contain completely different histories.

'''

* In this case, we want to pull the Rack project into our master project as a
  subdirectory.
* We can do that in Git with `git read-tree`.
* You'll learn more about `read-tree` and its friends in Git Internals, but
  for now know that it reads the root tree of one branch into your current
  staging area and working directory.
* We just switched back to your `master` branch, and we pull the `rack_branch`
  branch into the `rack` subdirectory of our master branch of our main
  project:
+
[source,sh]
$ git read-tree --prefix=rack/ -u rack_branch

* When we commit, it looks like we have all the Rack files under that
  subdirectory -- as though we copied them in from a tarball.
* What gets interesting is that we can fairly easily merge changes from one of
  the branches to the other.
* So, if the Rack project updates, we can pull in upstream changes by
  switching to that branch and pulling:
+
[source,sh]
$ git checkout rack_branch
$ git pull

* Then, we can merge those changes back into our `master` branch.
* To pull in the changes and prepopulate the commit message, use the
  `--squash` option, as well as the recursive merge strategy's `-Xsubtree`
  option.
* The recursive strategy is the default here, but we include it for clarity.
+
[source,sh]
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash -s recursive -Xsubtree=rack rack_branch
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested

* All the changes from the Rack project are merged in and ready to be
  committed locally.
* You can also do the opposite -- make changes in the `rack` subdirectory of
  your `master` branch and then merge them into your `rack_branch` branch
  later to submit them to the maintainers or push them upstream.

'''

* This gives us a way to have a workflow somewhat similar to the submodule
  workflow without using submodules (which we will cover in Submodules).
* We can keep branches with other related projects in our repository and
  subtree merge them into our project occasionally.
* It is nice in some ways, for example all the code is committed to a single
  place.
* However, it has other drawbacks in that it's a bit more complex and easier
  to make mistakes in reintegrating changes or accidentally pushing a branch
  into an unrelated repository.

'''

* Another slightly weird thing is that to get a diff between what you have in
  your `rack` subdirectory and the code in your `rack_branch` branch -- to see
  if you need to merge them -- you can't use the normal `diff` command.
* Instead, you must run `git diff-tree` with the branch you want to compare
  to:
+
[source,sh]
$ git diff-tree -p rack_branch

* Or, to compare what is in your `rack` subdirectory with what the master
  branch on the server was the last time you fetched, you can run:
+
[source,sh]
$ git diff-tree -p rack_remote/master
